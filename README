To run the code:
1. compile: make
2. run: ./a.out

To read the output:
By default, 6 groups tested, 
for each group, 5 pairs of graphs(dense/sparse) tested,
for each graph, 5 pairs of vertices(source/destination) tested.
Groups are separated by two lines of '--------',
graphs are separated by one line of '--------',
and the 6 bandwidth outputs are:
pure Dijkstra on dense graph,
pure Dijkstra on sparse graph,
heap-based Dijkstra on dense graph,
heap-based Dijkstra on sparse graph,
Kruskal on dense graph,
Kruskal on sparse graph.
At the end, the general statistic data will be reported.
