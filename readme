The source code is initially run on Xcode.
Due to the x86 architecture and the 64-bit MAC OS, it is problematic to create a makefile.

The executable file "MaxBandwidth.out" is contained here.
To run the file, use command:
	./MaxBandwidth.out
in terminal.

To generate new executable file from source files, use command:
	g++ -std=c++0x *.out
in terminal.

Introduction:
There are totally 5 groups, within each group, 5 different source-destination pairs are tested.
The final running-time statistic data will be shown at the end.
